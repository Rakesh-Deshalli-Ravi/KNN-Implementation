Project Description: This project implements the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch in Python. The KNN algorithm is a simple yet powerful machine learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. This implementation focuses on the classification aspect of KNN.

The project includes the following key components:
A basic KNN classifier function
Data preprocessing and normalization functions
A dating dataset example to demonstrate the algorithm's usage
Visualization tools to display the results
